# 1. Key Points & Requirements Summary
## 1.1 Business Goals
### Primary Objective:
- Create a scalable and flexible logistics application to track company assets.
- Allow easy addition and modification of assets and metadata in batch (via QR code or manual selection).
- Ensure multi-user, semi real-time updates.
### Target Users & Stakeholders:
- Initially, developers and office staff.
- Future expansion to other companies and external users.
### KPIs / Success Metrics:
- Reduce human errors compared to the Excel-based system.
- Reduce the number of steps and complexity of asset management.
### Budget & Timeline:
- 4-month timeframe for a functional prototype.
- No strict monetary budget but developer time is allocated.
## 1.2 Current Processes & Constraints
### Existing Process:
- Assets tracked in Excel with a row for each item and columns for metadata.
- Updates must be done by manually editing each cell; new columns are added for new metadata categories.
### Pain Points:
- High chance of human error when editing many items.
- No easy batch editing.
- Excel is not concurrent-user friendly.
### Regulations & Compliance:
- None required currently.
### Scalability:
- Fewer than 10 users initially, but must be designed to scale.
- Containerized CI/CD pipeline is desired.
## 1.3 Competitive Landscape
- Currently, no direct competitor for a flexible, extensible “asset management” style logistics system.
# 2. Project Organization
### Project Team:
- Single individual handling product management, UX/UI, development, and QA.
### Collaboration Model:
- In-house development.
- No complicated communication structure as it is a one-man project.
### Development Process:
- Agile-like approach (iterative).
### Deployment & Release Strategy:
- Deployed on Docker in an on-prem virtual machine.
- Reverse-proxied to the internet with a domain name.
## 2.2 Risk Management
### Key Risk:
- Developer’s limited experience in full-stack software development.
- Possible complexity in building features (batch editing, concurrency).
## 2.3 Documentation & Reporting
### Documentation:
- Markdown-based, stored with the code repository for version control.
### Status Updates:
- On-demand basis.
# 3. Technical Requirements
## 3.1 System Architecture & Platform
### Platform Choice:
- Web-based, containerized (Docker).
- On-prem deployment initially.
### Technology Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Next.js (API routes)
- Database: PostgreSQL
## 3.2 Required Features & Modules
### Core Functionalities:
- Semi real-time updates (prompt to refresh when changes occur).
- Bulk editing via QR/barcode scanning or manual selection.
- Dynamic metadata creation and filtering.
- Logging of user actions.
### User Roles & Permissions:
- Admin vs. warehouse users.
- Permissions tied to asset ownership metadata.
### Logging:
- All actions recorded for traceability.
## 3.3 Data & Integrations
### Data Source:
- Self-contained, no external integrations.
### Data Model Highlights:
- Required fields: asset tag (unique ID), owner, last modified.
- Dynamic metadata pairs: category, data.
### API & Authentication:
- JWT-based.
- No external API exposure for now.
## 3.4 Infrastructure & Deployment
### Hosting & CI/CD:
- Docker-based deployment.
- Potentially uploading images to Docker Hub, then pulling onto test/prod environment.
### Security & Compliance:
- No immediate requirements beyond basic best practices (JWT, user roles).
## 3.5 Performance & Scalability
### Performance Constraints:
- 500ms response time; otherwise show loading indicator.
### Scalability Plan:
- Future move to Kubernetes for horizontal scaling.
## 3.6 Testing & QA
### Testing Strategy:
- Minimal unit tests.
- Integration/end-to-end tests done manually by the developer.
### Testing Environment:
- Single environment (prototype).
# 4. UX & End-User Experience
### UX Goals:
- Simple, minimal, modern UI with a dark theme.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
### Training & Onboarding:
- Minimal training needed; a short guide is sufficient.
# 5. Maintenance & Updates
### Versioning & Release Lifecycle:
- Delivered as new Docker container builds.
- Developer pushes changes whenever updates are tested.
### Support Structure:
- Developer (and small internal user group) handles issues ad hoc.
# 6. Future Growth & Feedback
### Potential Add-ons:
- None planned beyond core functionalities.
### Feedback Loop:
- Direct feedback from colleagues and developer usage.
